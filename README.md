# My final Project for SheCodes React: Dictionary Deluxe

```
Half happy, half sad, I built my very final SheCodes project.
Sad, because I knew this was the last part of this first journey,
having felt so comfortable with the amazing SheCodes team and
their support. 
Happy, because it was so stunning to bring all my newly learned 
skills together to create a responsive dictionary application 
with a custom styling, which I am still	enthusiastic about 
to use myself! ðŸ“—
